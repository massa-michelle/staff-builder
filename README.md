# Staff Builder

## What is Staff Builder?
Staff Builer allows you to print colored staff sheets to aid those with dyslexia, others who have troubles reading traditional music sheets, or those who just want to add some color! Feel free to print and use as needed.

## How do I use Staff Builder?
With Staff Buider you can:
- Select the colors for the lines on your staff. You can also increase or decrease the width and spacing of
            the lines.
- Use preset values. There are several for you to choose from, including: "Grayscale", "Red/Green/Blue", and "Color Blind". These pallets have been pre-chosen by the developers, but feel free to create your own!
- After finding the perfect combination for you - hit print!
